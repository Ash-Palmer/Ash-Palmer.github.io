    <p>"If we neglect the opportunity to attend as often as our circumstances 
        allow, if we take lightly the opportunity to go to the temple when 
        it is right in our backyard, so to speak, we may forfeit future 
        blessings and opportunities our Father and His Son have in store 
        for us. “I, the Lord,” He said, “am bound when ye do what I say; 
        but when ye do not what I say, ye have no promise” (D&C 82:10)."

    <h2>The Temple Gives Us Higher Vision</h2>
    <p>Whether we come to the temple with hearts full of joy or heavy with 
        sorrow, the temple is the place for every worthy member with an open 
        heart to be lifted and strengthened.</p>

    <p>I have come to the temple almost floating in deep gratitude for a 
        blessing granted to a struggling loved one; I have also shed quiet 
        tears of great sorrow for my own failures. I have received promptings 
        and instruction and even rebukes from the Spirit while serving as 
        proxy for someone receiving the ordinances that will allow her to 
        progress through eternity. All of those experiences have lifted and 
        strengthened me. And yes, I’ve sat through many an hour in the temple 
        as a “duty,” simply fulfilling my obligation, and I even found myself 
        dozing off during temple sessions in my years as an early-morning 
        seminary teacher! But every single time I’ve gone to the temple, I 
        have been blessed. Whether we are granted an immediate blessing or our 
        efforts accrue toward later blessings, every bit of time we spend in 
        the temple results in some personal increase.</p>

    <p>Being in the temple reminds us of the span of eternity, both looking 
        back at our ancestors and forward to our children. Our children are 
        also strengthened in their eternal perspective when they focus on the 
        temple. How can we best prepare them for the temple﻿—a vital step in 
        their eternal progression? President Russell M. Nelson, President of 
        the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles, counseled, “Parents should teach 
        the importance of the temple from a child’s earliest days.”2 President 
        Spencer W. Kimball (1895–1985) advised parents to put a picture of the 
        temple in their children’s bedroom so they can look at that sacred 
        reminder every day until it becomes part of them.</p>

    <p>You can also share with your children the blessings you receive from 
        attending the temple as well as your testimony of the joy you 
        anticipate in eternal relationships with them. And you can support 
        your teenagers in their desire to perform baptisms for the dead. 
        Remember in your family home evening lessons and teaching moments 
        that “the temple is the object of every activity, every lesson, 
        every progressive step in the Church.”</p>
